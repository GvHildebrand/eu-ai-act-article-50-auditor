## What was audited

Two AI systems Vigilia puts into service on its public site:

1. **the publishing agent** — an autonomous AI agent that writes and publishes
   research dispatches on AI regulation and safety;
2. **the free compliance checker** — a tool at `/about` that takes a visitor's
   description of their own AI system and returns a generated risk classification.

Evidence was captured from the live site on 2026-09-06 and, for the marking, on
2026-09-09: the dispatch page as a
reader meets it, the checker surface with every string shown at it, the complete
machine-readable metadata of a published dispatch, the checker's response
construction, the homepage disclosure section and compliance table, `llms.txt`,
and the site's Organization structured data.

**Scope limit, stated up front.** Only public surfaces were examined. The
authenticated €499 workspace, and any content generated inside it, were not.

## Scoping determination

| Question | Answer | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Provider, deployer, or both? | **Both** — provider under Art. 3(3) and 3(11) ("putting into service … for own use"), deployer when it publishes the output | `system-facts.md:L12` |
| Output modalities generated | Text only | `system-facts.md:L13` |
| Available to persons in the EU? | Yes — `areaServed: EU`, five locales | `documents/structured-data.md` |
| Placed on the market / put into service | **Before 2 August 2026** — dispatch archive runs back to 21 April 2026 | `system-facts.md:L15` |
| Emotion recognition / biometric categorisation? | Neither | `system-facts.md:L16-L17` |
| Text published to inform the public on matters of public interest? | **Yes** — dispatches on AI regulation and safety | `system-facts.md:L19` |
| Law-enforcement authorisation claimed? | No | `system-facts.md:L21` |
| Marking technique for synthetic text | **Found at the third run** — IPTC `digitalSourceType` in the dispatch JSON-LD and RSS feed, a provenance header and block on the checker response; none on 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-06 | `system-facts.md:L23` |

Being **both** provider and deployer is what makes this artifact useful as an
example: unlike the two fixtures, Vigilia is exposed to 50(2) *and* to 50(4), and
the audit has to keep the two duties apart rather than collapsing them into
"do they disclose?".

The placement date puts the 50(2) marking duty inside the Article 111(4)
transitional window, which closes on **2 December 2026** — a determination the
operator's own published compliance table independently reaches.

## Summary

### How much of this rests on the operator's word

| Evidence | Verdicts | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `observed` | 6 | the auditor saw the artifact itself — a rendered surface, a real output file, a response header |
| `inferred` | 3 | derived from something *about* the artifact — source code, an archive snapshot, a public record |
| `declared` | 0 | the operator said so, and nothing independent confirms it |
| `none` | 2 | the provision imposes no duty, so there is nothing to evidence |

**0 of 11 verdicts would collapse if the operator's statements were false.** Every finding
carries its own `provenance`, so you can see which ones. `tools/verify_citations.py`
recomputes these totals from the findings and fails the report if the header
misstates them — an audit may not understate how much it is trusting.

**This is the third run.** The first, on 2026-09-03, returned one MAJOR and one
MINOR. The MAJOR was remediated and became a PASS on 2026-09-06. The MINOR was
remediated and became a PASS on 2026-09-09 — and that remediation activated an
obligation which had been NOT_APPLICABLE while there was nothing to grade, and
which now scores a smaller MINOR of its own. The record of what each run said is
kept rather than overwritten: the superseded captures are preserved in the
evidence pack, and F-02, F-03 and F-08 below carry their history.

| | |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | ~~F-08 · the free compliance checker generates AI prose with no disclosure at the point of interaction.~~ **Remediated 2026-09-06.** The disclosure now sits above the submit control and is repeated on the returned snapshot, in five languages. Now PASS. |
| **MINOR** | ~~F-02 · no machine-readable mark of synthetic content on any output.~~ **Remediated 2026-09-08, verified live 2026-09-09.** IPTC `digitalSourceType` in the dispatch structured data and feed; a provenance header and block on the checker response. Now PASS. |
| **MINOR** | F-03 · the marking technique is metadata beside the text — interoperable and consistently applied, and not robust to the prose being copied out, which is the limit of what is technically feasible for plain text. Assessable for the first time now that a technique exists. **Open, and expected to stay open until the state of the art for text moves.** |

Five PASS, one PARTIAL, three NOT_APPLICABLE, two OBSERVATION, no FAIL. The strong
human-facing disclosure that earns the passes on 50(1), 50(4) and 50(5) did nothing
for 50(2), which is a duty owed to machines. That gap is now closed, and what the
closing exposed — that a mark on plain text cannot yet follow the text when it is
copied — is the most instructive thing left in this report.

**Fix next:** nothing that is technically feasible today. F-03 stays open by the
nature of text, not by neglect: re-test the mark on every new text-producing
surface, and adopt a copy-surviving technique when one is generally acknowledged.

**On the value of a self-audit that changed something.** The first run of this
report was published with a MAJOR against its own author's commercial product.
Three days later the defect is fixed and the verdict moved. Five days after that
the second defect is fixed, a second verdict moved, and a third opened — which is
what a re-run is for. That sequence — find, publish, remediate, re-run, keep the
old capture — is the only evidence anyone should accept that an audit tool does
anything at all.

## Findings

### F-01 · Article 50(1) · PASS

Vigilia puts two AI systems into service that interact directly with natural
persons: the publishing agent, whose output a reader meets on every dispatch, and
the free compliance checker, which answers a visitor's description of their own AI
system. The trigger is met for both.

The duty in 50(1) is to ensure the natural persons concerned **are informed** that
they are interacting with an AI system. They are. The dispatch byline says so
above the headline; the site footer says so on every page, including the page
carrying the checker; `llms.txt` says so again for machine consumers. There is no
persona, no human byline, and nothing that would lead a reader to think otherwise.

Neither exemption was relied on. **EUAIA-50-1-X2** is out — no law-enforcement
authorisation. **EUAIA-50-1-X1**, the "obvious" carve-out, would have been
arguable for a service whose entire identity is a disclosed AI agent, but it is
not needed and is not claimed: Vigilia states the fact outright.

That the information *exists* is this obligation. **Whether it reaches the person
clearly and at the right moment is Article 50(5), and that is where the checker
runs into trouble** — see F-08. Keeping the two apart is the difference between a
finding that can be acted on and a vague complaint.

```

### F-02 · Article 50(2), first sentence · PASS

**Verdict changed at the 2026-09-09 re-run. It was FAIL / MINOR on 2026-09-03 and
again on 2026-09-06.**

Vigilia is the provider of AI systems generating synthetic **text**: the dispatches
and the checker's snapshot prose. Article 3(11) makes putting a system into service
"for own use" enough to be a provider, so running the publishing agent for its own
site does not take Vigilia outside 50(2). Neither exemption applies
(**EUAIA-50-2-X1**, **EUAIA-50-2-X2**), as before.

**The output is now marked, on every surface examined.** Read from the live site on
2026-09-09: the dispatch's `BlogPosting` JSON-LD carries `digitalSourceType` with
both the IPTC `trainedAlgorithmicMedia` URI and the schema.org
`TrainedAlgorithmicMediaDigitalSource` member; the RSS feed item carries the same
IPTC value as a `<category>` in the IPTC domain; and the checker's response carries
an `X-Content-Provenance: synthetic; digitalSourceType="…trainedAlgorithmicMedia"`
header and a `provenance` block in the body with `syntheticContent: true`, the IPTC
value, a `generatedBy` line and a link to the disclosure page. The operator dates
the change to 2026-09-08; the verdict rests on what was read live, not on the
operator's word.

**What the previous runs said, kept rather than deleted.** On 2026-09-03 and again
on 2026-09-06 no output carried any machine-readable mark: the structured data named
an Organization as author, which marks *who published* and not that the text was
generated, and the checker returned bare JSON with a single `Set-Cookie` header.
That returned FAIL, and inside the Article 111(4) window it scored MINOR, with the
note that the same evidence would return CRITICAL on 2 December 2026. The superseded
captures stay in the evidence pack (`outputs/dispatch-structured-data.md`,
`outputs/checker-response.md`) beside the new ones.

The deadline still matters to the record: the artifact was placed before 2 August
2026, so 50(2) reaches it through Article 111(4) on 2 December 2026, and the mark
was in place before that date.

**What this pass does not say.** The first sentence asks that outputs be marked in
a machine-readable format and detectable as artificially generated. It does not
ask whether the mark survives a reader copying the prose out of the page. That is
the second sentence's question — effective, interoperable, robust and reliable so
far as technically feasible — and it is scored at F-03, which this remediation has
activated for the first time.

finding: Every output of both text-generating systems examined now carries a machine-readable mark identifying it as artificially generated — IPTC digitalSourceType in the dispatch structured data and feed, a provenance header and block on the checker response — in place before the Article 111(4) deadline of 2 December 2026; the earlier captures that found no mark are kept in the evidence pack.
remediation: None outstanding. Re-test on any change to the dispatch template, the feed route or the checker handler, since a mark generated by code disappears when the code that generates it is refactored; the operator keeps the identifiers in one file for that reason.
```

### F-03 · Article 50(2), second sentence · PARTIAL · MINOR

**Verdict changed at the 2026-09-09 re-run. It was NOT_APPLICABLE on 2026-09-03 and
2026-09-06, because no marking technique existed to assess.**

The second sentence grades the technique: effective, interoperable, robust and
reliable, so far as technically feasible, taking into account the type of content,
the cost of implementation and the generally acknowledged state of the art. A
technique now exists, so the obligation is live and the qualifier does the work the
first run said it would.

**Interoperable and effective, as far as a mark on text can be.** The vocabulary is
the IPTC digital-source-type NewsCode — the term the schema.org enumeration mirrors
and the one the Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-Generated Content points at.
A reader of JSON-LD, of RSS or of an HTTP response finds it in the place each
format keeps such statements, without a Vigilia-specific vocabulary; the checker
adds a plain boolean, `syntheticContent: true`, for a client that has never heard
of IPTC. Both dispatch surfaces and the checker carry the mark, so it is applied
consistently across the outputs examined.

**Not robust to the ordinary thing a reader does with text.** The mark is metadata
beside the prose. It travels with the page, the feed item and the response; it
does not travel with the sentences when they are copied into a document, a message
or another site, and the evidence file says so in the operator's own capture. No
technique in general use marks plain text in a way that survives copying — there
is no C2PA binding for HTML prose and no accepted text watermark — so this is the
state of the art rather than a shortfall against it. That is why the verdict is
PARTIAL and not FAIL, and why the qualified duty caps the severity at MINOR: the
solution is as robust as the type of content allows, and the standard asks only
for what is technically feasible.

**What would move this to PASS.** A generally acknowledged technique for marking
plain text that survives copying, adopted here when it exists — or a technical
standard under 50(7) that settles metadata as sufficient for text. Until one of
those, this is the honest grade for any text-only provider, and an auditor that
scored a metadata mark on text as fully robust would be grading the format, not
the outcome.

evidence_quote: The mark is metadata beside the text. It travels with the page, with the feed item and with the HTTP response; it does not travel with the prose if a reader copies the words out of the page.
finding: The marking technique is interoperable and consistently applied — the IPTC digital-source-type vocabulary in JSON-LD, RSS and an HTTP header, with a plain synthetic-content flag beside it — but it is metadata on the container and does not survive the prose being copied out, which is the limit of what is technically feasible for plain text today; the duty reaches this artifact through Article 111(4) on 2 December 2026, and this is the grade it would carry on that date.
remediation: Adopt a text-marking technique that survives copying if one becomes generally acknowledged, or a 50(7) standard that settles metadata as sufficient for text; until then keep the mark on every text-producing surface and re-test whenever one is added.
```

### F-04 · Article 50(3), first limb · NOT_APPLICABLE

No emotion recognition system and no biometric categorisation system within
Article 3(39) and 3(40). The checker classifies a *system description* into a risk
tier; it processes no biometric data and infers no emotional state from any natural
person. Classifying text is not biometric categorisation, and the definitions in
`reference/32024R1689/article-3-definitions.md` are what settle that.

finding: Neither an emotion recognition system nor a biometric categorisation system is operated, so the Article 50(3) trigger is not met.
```

### F-05 · Article 50(3), second limb · NOT_APPLICABLE

Follows F-04. The limb binds a deployer whose system has met the 50(3) trigger, and
that trigger is not met. This is not a statement about Vigilia's data protection
position generally, which is outside the scope this auditor declares.

```

### F-06 · Article 50(4), first subparagraph · NOT_APPLICABLE

No generated image, audio or video was found on the public surfaces examined. The
site's principal image is a photograph of an existing sculpture by Adolf von
Hildebrand, credited on the page — a photograph of a real object, not synthetic
media, and nothing about it would falsely appear authentic within Article 3(60).

Scope limit stated plainly: this determination covers the public surfaces in the
evidence pack. The authenticated €499 workspace was not examined. If report
generation there produces synthetic imagery, this obligation would need to be
re-run against it.

finding: No generated image, audio or video content was found on the public surfaces examined, so nothing can constitute a deep fake; the authenticated workspace was outside the scope of this audit.
```

### F-07 · Article 50(4), second subparagraph · PASS

This is the obligation Vigilia is most exposed to and the one it handles best.

The trigger is met on both limbs and it is not close. The dispatches are AI-
generated text, they are published openly and syndicated by RSS, and their subject
matter — AI regulation, enforcement action, safety research, market concentration —
is squarely informing the public on matters of public interest. Vigilia is the
deployer of the system that generates them.

**The editorial exemption is available and is not used.** EUAIA-50-4-X4 needs two
limbs together: human review or editorial control, *and* a natural or legal person
holding editorial responsibility. Vigilia has a named human taking corrections and
approving production changes, so it could plausibly argue the exemption and publish
nothing. It discloses instead — byline, colophon, footer — which is the stronger
position and the one the obligation is written to encourage. An auditor should say
so when an operator declines a lawful escape hatch.

The disclosure states the substance the provision asks for: that the text is the
work of an autonomous AI agent. Placement and manner are assessed at F-08, and on
this surface they are also good — the byline sits above the headline.

finding: AI-generated text published to inform the public on matters of public interest is disclosed as such in the byline and colophon of every dispatch, without recourse to the editorial-responsibility exemption.
```

### F-08 · Article 50(5), first sentence · PASS

**Verdict changed at the 2026-09-06 re-run. It was PARTIAL / MAJOR on 2026-09-03.**

50(5) governs how the information under paragraphs 1 to 4 reaches people: clearly,
distinguishably, and **at the latest at the time of the first interaction or
exposure**. Two surfaces are in play. At the first run they diverged; they no
longer do.

**The dispatches pass, comfortably, and did before.** The disclosure is in the
byline, above the headline, before a word of the article can be read. It is its
own element, plainly worded, and repeated in a colophon at the end.

**The free compliance checker now passes too.** Read from the live DOM on
2026-09-06: a `<p>` element carrying "This analysis is generated by Vigilia, an
AI system." sits above the submit control, twenty-four pixels clear of it, in
black on the white ground, as live text rather than an image or a background,
without `aria-hidden`, and before the button in document order — so a
screen-reader user meets it at the same point a sighted reader does. It is
repeated beneath the result header, so the disclosure travels with the output if
that block is screenshotted or read alone. Both strings are localised and were
confirmed live in all five languages.

The site footer still carries the publisher-level statement. The verdict no
longer rests on it, which is the point: the disclosure is now made at the surface
where the interaction happens, by the tool, about the tool.

**What the previous run said, kept rather than deleted.** On 2026-09-03 nothing
at that surface said the analysis was produced by an AI system; the only AI
disclosure reachable was the site footer, below the tool and encountered after
the interaction. That returned PARTIAL, and on an absolute duty in force the
matrix returned MAJOR — the most severe finding in the first run. The superseded
capture is preserved in the evidence pack so the remediation can be checked
against what it replaced.

It was worth naming the irony then and it is worth naming the resolution now: the
checker whose purpose is to find Article 50 gaps in other people's products
contained one, its own auditor found it, and it was fixed in three days.

```

### F-09 · Article 50(5), second sentence · PASS

Ruled narrowly, for the reason the register records: the applicable accessibility
requirements live in other instruments, principally Directive (EU) 2019/882 and
Directive (EU) 2016/2102, and those texts are **not** in this repository's
`reference/`. Pronouncing conformity with a standard the folder does not contain
would be precisely the opinion-generating this auditor exists to avoid.

What the evidence does establish is that the disclosures are perceivable. The
byline is server-rendered live text inside a semantic `aside`, in normal reading
order, with no `aria-hidden`; it is not an image, not a background, and not
conveyed by colour alone. The dagger glyph beside it is decorative and carries no
meaning the text does not also carry. The colophon and footer are likewise plain
text. A screen-reader user meets the same disclosure a sighted reader does, at the
same point.

Full conformance assessment against the accessibility directives is referred
onward, not asserted. Note also that this verdict is about the disclosure that
exists; at the first run the checker surface had no disclosure to make accessible,
which F-08 records. It has one now, and it is live text in reading order.

```

### F-10 · Article 50(6) · NOTED · OBSERVATION

Reported so this document cannot be quoted as more than it is. Vigilia sells EU AI
Act audits; a favourable Article 50 report about itself would be a marketing asset,
and the boundary matters more here than usual.

This audit says nothing about Chapter III, nothing about Article 5, nothing about
the GPAI obligations in Chapter V, and nothing about the GDPR. Recital 137 is
explicit that compliance with the transparency obligations is not to be read as
indicating that the use of an AI system or its output is lawful.

```

### F-11 · Article 50(7) · NOTED · OBSERVATION

Binds the Commission, not Vigilia, so there is nothing here to comply with.

Directly relevant all the same: the Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-Generated
Content was assessed adequate by the Commission on 8 July 2026 and by the AI Board
on 9 July 2026 for Articles 50(2), (4) and (5). It is where the marking technique
missing at F-02 should come from, and the remediation there points at it.

Adherence is voluntary and confers no presumption of conformity — recital 41 of
Regulation (EU) 2026/1744 says so. Signing it would be evidence toward F-02, never
a verdict on it. This paragraph is also the single provision of Article 50 that the
Digital Omnibus amended.

```finding
id: F-11
provision: EUAIA-50-7
verdict: NOTED
severity: OBSERVATION
duty_force: no_direct_duty
applicability: in_force
provenance: none
cite: reference/32024R1689/article-50.md:L28
quote: The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content.
finding: Reported as an observation: Article 50(7) binds the Commission, and adherence to the transparency Code of Practice would be voluntary evidence toward F-02 rather than compliance in itself.

## Matters noted outside the scope of this audit

An audit reports what it was asked to look at. It should also say when it walked
past something a reasonable reader would want to know, rather than pretending not
to have seen it. The following is **not** an Article 50 finding, carries no
verdict and no severity, and is recorded here because it was encountered while
gathering evidence.

The dispatch used as the evidence artifact —
[*Commission Enforces AI Act Transparency from 2 August 2026*](https://aivigilia.com/blog/commission-enforces-ai-act-transparency-2-august-2026),
published 25 August 2026 — **described Article 50 incorrectly**, in three ways
that the text shipped in this repository's `reference/` contradicts directly.

| The dispatch said | The Regulation says |
|---|---|
| "Article 50 imposes transparency obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models." | Article 50 binds providers and deployers of **certain AI systems**. Obligations on providers of general-purpose AI **models** are Article 53, in Chapter V. |
| Those obligations "include public documentation of training data characteristics, computational resources used, testing procedures, and known limitations", plus adversarial testing and serious-incident tracking for systemic-risk models. | Those are the Article 53(1) and Article 55(1) obligations, and they have applied since **2 August 2025**. Article 50's seven paragraphs are reproduced in full at `reference/32024R1689/article-50.md` and contain none of them. |
| "Penalties for non-compliance with Article 50 are structured at 1% of global annual turnover." | Article 99(4)(g) puts Article 50 in the **EUR 15 000 000 or 3 %** tier. The 1 % figure is Article 99(5), which penalises supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to authorities — a different infringement. |

The error understated the penalty exposure of the provision by a factor of three
and attached it to the wrong actor. It also ran through the article's argument:
the fragility research it reported bears on the Article 53 and 55 documentation
duties, not on Article 50 at all.

**Corrected on 3 September 2026**, the same day this audit was run, across the
English original and all four translations, with a dated correction notice
carried at the top of each. The commit is
[`3f990ea`](https://github.com/GvHildebrand/vigilia) in the Vigilia repository.
The argument survived the correction; it simply lands on the right provisions now.

This is the failure mode the whole repository is built around, found in the
operator's own work: a summary of a standard, written by an AI, drifting from the
standard, published, and read by people who had no way to check it. The article
sat on the site of a company that sells Article 50 audits, for nine days.

It is also the reason `reference/` exists in the form it does. Nothing in this
report could have made that mistake and survived `verify_citations.py`, because
every claim in the eleven findings above quotes the provision it relies on and the
script checks the quote against the authentic text, byte for byte. The dispatch had
no such check, and so it went out wrong — and stayed wrong until something with a
copy of the law read it.

**Still outstanding, and outside this audit:** the same citation discipline has not
been run over the rest of the published archive, and the generator that produced
the error is upstream in a separate repository.

## Attestation

| | |
|---|---|
| Standard | Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, Article 50, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2026/1744 |
| Authentic text | OJ L, 2024/1689, 12.7.2024 — shipped verbatim in `reference/32024R1689/` |
| Reference fingerprint | `3fa2319d6595d47a` |
| Register version | 1.0.0 |
| Obligations in register | 11 — all reported above |

Check every citation in this report against the text it cites:

```bash
python3 tools/verify_citations.py <this file>
```

**Scope limits.** This audit covers Article 50 and nothing else. Article 50(6)
provides that paragraphs 1 to 4 do not affect the requirements and obligations of
Chapter III and are without prejudice to other transparency obligations in Union
or national law. Recital 137 provides that compliance with the transparency
obligations is not to be interpreted as indicating that the use of the AI system
or its output is lawful.

**This is not legal advice** and it is not a conformity assessment. It is a
documented comparison of an artifact against a published text, written so that
every statement in it can be checked against that text.
